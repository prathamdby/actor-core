Actor state provides the best of both worlds: it's stored in-memory and persisted automatically. This lets you work with the data without added latency while still being able to survive crashes & upgrades.

<Tip>
**Using External SQL Databases**

Actors can also be used with external SQL databases. This can be useful to integrate actors with existing
applications or for storing relational data. Read more [here](/concepts/external-sql).
</Tip>

## State Isolation

Each actor's state is completely isolated, meaning it cannot be accessed directly by other actors or clients. This allows actors to maintain a high level of security and data integrity, ensuring that state changes are controlled and predictable

To interact with an actor's state, you must use [Remote Procedure Calls](/concepts/remote-procedure-calls) (RPC). RPCs provide a controlled way to read from and write to the state.

### Shared State

If you need a shared state between multiple actors, you have two options:

1. Create an actor that holds the shared state that actors can make RPCs to
2. Use an external database, see [External SQL Databases](/concepts/external-sql)

## Native State

Native state is a native JavaScript object stored in-memory on `this._state`. This makes building realtime & stateful applications as simple as working with native JavaScript objects.

### Initializing & Updating State

Actors with native state require an `_initializeState` method. The object returned will be automatically persisted and assigned to `this._state`. `_initializeState` is only called once when the actor is created. See [Lifecycle](/concepts/lifecycle) for more details.

To update state, assign or update `this._state`. Any modifications will be automatically persisted.

For example:

```typescript actor.ts
import { Actor, type Rpc } from "actor-core";

// Define the state's structure
interface State {
	count: number;
}

export default class Counter extends Actor<State> {
	// Automatically called the first time the actor is created
	_onInitialize(): State {
		// Initialize the state with a count of 0
		return { count: 0 };
	}

	// Define RPC call to update state
	increment(rpc: Rpc<Counter>) {
		// Update state, this will automatically be persisted
		this._state.count += 1;
	}
}
```

<Note>
	Only state stored on the `this._state` property will be persisted. All other properties of the `Counter`
	class are kept in-memory and not persisted.
</Note>

### State Saves

Actors automatically handle persisting state transparently. This happens at the end of every remote procedure call if the state has changed.

In the rare occasion you need to force a state change mid-RPC, you can use `_saveState`. This should only be used if your remote procedure call makes an important state change that needs to be persisted before the RPC exits.

### Limitations

State is constrained to the available memory.

Only JSON-serializable types can be stored in state. In serverless runtimes that support it (Rivet, Cloudflare Workers), state is persisted under the hood in a compact, binary format. This is because JavaScript classes cannot be serialized & deserialized.
