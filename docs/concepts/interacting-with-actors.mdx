This guide covers how to connect to and interact with actors from client applications.

## Setting Up the Client

The first step is to create a client:

```typescript
import { Client } from "actor-core/client";

// Create a client with the connection address
const client = new Client(/* CONNECTION ADDRESS */);
```

<Tip>See the setup guide for your platform for details on how to get the connection address.</Tip>

## Finding & Connecting to Actors

ActorCore provides several methods to connect to actors:

### `get(tags, opts)` - Find or Create

The most common way to connect is with `get()`, which finds an existing actor matching the provided tags or creates a new one:

```typescript
// Connect to a chat room for the "general" channel
const room = await client.get<ChatRoom>({
  name: "chat_room",
  channel: "general"
});

// Now you can call methods on the actor
await room.sendMessage("Alice", "Hello everyone!");
```

### `create(opts)` - Explicitly Create New

When you specifically want to create a new actor instance:

```typescript
// Create a new document actor
const doc = await client.create<MyDocument>({
  create: {
    tags: {
      name: "my_document",
      docId: "123"
    }
  }
});

await doc.initializeDocument("My New Document");
```

### `getWithId(id, opts)` - Connect by ID

Connect to an actor using its internal ID:

```typescript
// Connect to a specific actor by its ID
const myActorId = "55425f42-82f8-451f-82c1-6227c83c9372";
const doc = await client.getWithId<MyDocument>(myActorId);

await doc.updateContent("Updated content");
```

<Note>
It's usually better to use tags for discovery rather than directly using actor IDs.
</Note>

## Sending Remote Procedure Calls

Once connected, calling actor methods with [remote procedure calls](/concepts/remote-procedure-calls) is straightforward:

```typescript
// Call an actor method
const result = await actor.multiplyByTwo(5);
console.log(result); // 10

// Call a method with multiple parameters
await chatRoom.sendMessage("Alice", "Hello everyone!");

// Call a method with an object parameter
await gameRoom.updateSettings({
  maxPlayers: 10,
  timeLimit: 300,
  gameMode: "capture-the-flag"
});
```

<Note>
All actor method calls are asynchronous and require `await`, even if the actor's method is not async.
</Note>

## Listening for Events

Actors can send realtime updates to clients using events:

### `on(eventName, callback)` - Continuous Listening

To listen for events that will happen repeatedly:

```typescript
// Listen for new chat messages
chatRoom.on("newMessage", ({ sender, text, timestamp }) => {
  console.log(`${sender}: ${text}`);
  updateChatUI(sender, text, timestamp);
});

// Listen for game state updates
gameRoom.on("stateUpdate", (gameState) => {
  updateGameUI(gameState);
});
```

### `once(eventName, callback)` - One-time Listening

For events you only need to hear once:

```typescript
// Listen for when a request is approved
actor.once("requestApproved", () => {
  showApprovalNotification();
  unlockFeatures();
});
```

## Connection Options

### Authentication and Connection Parameters

Pass information with your connection using the `parameters` option:

```typescript
const chatRoom = await client.get<ChatRoom>(
  { name: "chat_room", channel: "private" },
  {
    parameters: { 
      userId: "1234",
      authToken: "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
      displayName: "Alice"
    }
  }
);
```

The actor can access these parameters:

```typescript
export default class ChatRoom extends Actor<State, ConnectionParams> {
  _onBeforeConnect(opts: OnBeforeConnectOptions<ChatRoom>) {
    // Validate authentication token
    const { userId, authToken, displayName } = opts.parameters;
    validateToken(userId, authToken);
    
    // Return connection state
    return { userId, displayName };
  }
}
```

Read more about [connection parameters](/concepts/connections).

### Additional Options

#### `opts.create.tags`

Specify additional tags when creating an actor:

```typescript
const actor = client.get<MyDocument>(
  // Tags used to find the actor
  {
    name: "my_document",
    document_id: "budget_2024"
  },
  {
    create: {
      // Additional tags if a new actor is created
      tags: {
        name: "my_document",
        workspace_id: "team_alpha",
        document_id: "budget_2024",
        created_by: "user_123"
      }
    }
  }
);
```

By default, the tags passed to the first parameter will be used when creating a new actor.

#### `opts.create.region`

Specify a region when creating an actor:

```typescript
const actor = client.get<GameServer>(
  { name: "game_server" },
  {
    create: {
      region: "eu-west"
    }
  }
);
```

<Info>
	Not all platforms support multiple regions. Read the platform's ActorCore docs for more information.
</Info>

#### `opts.noCreate`

Connect only if an actor exists, without creating a new one:

```typescript
try {
  const doc = await client.get<MyDocument>(
    { name: "my_document", docId: "123" }, 
    { noCreate: true }
  );
  await doc.doSomething();
} catch (error) {
  console.log("Document doesn't exist");
}
```

## Client Options

```typescript
// Example with all client options
const client = new Client(
  "https://actors.example.com",
  {
    // Data serialization format
    encoding: "cbor", // or "json"
    
    // Network transports in order of preference
    supportedTransports: ["websocket", "sse"]
  }
);
```

### `encoding`

`"cbor" | "json"` (optional)

Specifies the data encoding format used for communication:

- `"cbor"` (default): Binary format that's more efficient for data transfer
- `"json"`: Text-based format with wider compatibility across environments

### `supportedTransports`

`("websocket" | "sse")[]` (optional)

Configures which network transport mechanisms the client will use to communicate with actors, sorted by priority:

- `"websocket"`: Real-time bidirectional communication, best for most applications
- `"sse"` (Server-Sent Events): Works in more restricted environments where WebSockets may be blocked

Default is `["websocket", "sse"]`, which automatically negotiates the best available option.

## Error Handling

ActorCore provides specific error types to help you handle different failure scenarios:

### RPC Errors

When a remote procedure call fails, it throws an `RpcError` with details about the failure:

```typescript
try {
  await actor.someMethod();
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof RpcError) {
    console.error(`RPC failed: ${error.code} - ${error.message}`);
    // Handle specific error codes
    if (error.code === "permission_denied") {
      // Handle permission errors
    }
  }
}
```

These errors can be thrown from within the actor with `UserError`:

```typescript
import { UserError, Actor, type Rpc } from "actor-core";

export default class DocumentActor extends Actor {
  async editDocument(rpc: Rpc<DocumentActor>, userId: string) {
    // Check if user has permission to edit
    if (!this.#hasPermission(userId, "edit")) {
      throw new UserError("You don't have permission to edit this document", {
        code: "permission_denied",
        metadata: { userId }
      });
    }
    
    // ...
  }
}
```

ActorCore forces you to subclass `UserError` instead of returning all errors to the client because returning raw errors can expose information about the internals of your application or expose secrets.

### Other Errors

Other common errors you might encounter:

- `InternalError`: Error from your actor that's not a subclass of `UserError`
- `ManagerError`: Issues when connecting to or communicating with the actor manager
- `NoSupportedTransport`: When the client and server have no compatible transport

## Disconnecting and Cleanup

The client connection is automatically cleaned up when it goes out of scope.

If you need to explicitly disconnect:

```typescript
// Disconnect from the actor
await actor.disconnect();

// Disconnect the entire client
await client.disconnect();
```

## Offline and Auto-Reconnection

Clients automatically attempt to reconnect (with [exponential backoff](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/retry-backoff.html)) when disconnected. Remote procedure calls made while disconnected are queued.
 
On reconnection, event subscriptions are reestablished & queued RPCs are executed.

This makes your applications resilient to temporary network failures without any extra code.
